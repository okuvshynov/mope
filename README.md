# Expert Parallelism for MLX-LM MoE Models

This repository contains a proof of concept implementation of expert parallelism for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models using the MLX-LM framework, specifically targeting the Qwen3-Coder-30B model.

## Overview

Expert parallelism is a distributed inference strategy for MoE models where experts are distributed across multiple devices/nodes, allowing for:
- **Memory efficiency**: Each device only stores a subset of experts
- **Compute efficiency**: Only active experts are computed per token
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale to more devices as expert count increases

## Architecture Analysis

**Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-4bit Model:**
- **Total parameters**: ~30B (quantized to 4-bit)
- **Architecture**: 48 transformer layers, all with MoE
- **Experts per layer**: 128 experts
- **Active experts per token**: 8 (6.25% utilization)
- **Hidden size**: 2048
- **MoE intermediate size**: 768

## Implementation

### 1. Basic POC (`expert_parallel_poc.py`)
A standalone implementation demonstrating:
- Expert distribution across simulated devices
- Token routing and load balancing analysis
- Parallel expert computation simulation
- Performance analysis and bottleneck identification

### 2. Real Model Integration (`qwen3_expert_parallel.py`)
Integration with the actual Qwen3 model:
- Patches existing MoE layers with expert-parallel versions
- Real-time routing analysis during inference
- Load balancing metrics and efficiency calculations
- Device memory distribution simulation

### 3. Model Analysis (`model_analysis.py`)
Detailed analysis of the Qwen3 model architecture:
- Layer-by-layer breakdown of MoE vs regular layers
- Expert weight shapes and memory requirements
- Forward pass analysis and routing behavior

## Key Results

### Memory Distribution
- **8 devices**: Each device stores 16 experts (~3.75B parameters)
- **Memory reduction**: 8x per device compared to full model
- **Active memory**: Only 8 experts active per token (efficient compute)

### Performance Characteristics
- **Expert utilization**: ~6.25% of experts active per token
- **Load balancing**: Varies with routing patterns (0.3-1.0 balance ratio)
- **Communication overhead**: ~16KB per token (8 expert outputs × 2048 hidden size)
- **Theoretical speedup**: ~16x compute efficiency vs. dense model

### Load Balancing Analysis
The POC demonstrates different routing scenarios:
- **Balanced routing**: Even distribution across devices
- **Skewed routing**: Some devices overloaded
- **Hot expert scenario**: Single expert dominates traffic

## Running the Code

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install mlx-lm numpy
```

### Basic POC
```bash
python expert_parallel_poc.py
```

### Model Architecture Analysis
```bash
python model_analysis.py
```

### Real Model Integration
```bash
python qwen3_expert_parallel.py
```

### Simple Example
```bash
python minimal_qwen3_example.py
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Expert Distribution Strategy
```python
def create_expert_device_mapping(num_experts: int, num_devices: int) -> Dict[int, int]:
    """Distribute experts evenly across devices"""
    experts_per_device = num_experts // num_devices
    return {expert_id: expert_id // experts_per_device for expert_id in range(num_experts)}
```

### Routing and Load Balancing
- Token routing uses top-k selection (k=8 for Qwen3)
- Router network computes expert probabilities
- Load balancing measured by device utilization variance
- Hot expert detection and mitigation strategies

### Communication Pattern
1. **Broadcast**: Input tokens sent to all devices
2. **Compute**: Each device processes its assigned experts
3. **Gather**: Expert outputs collected and weighted
4. **Aggregate**: Final output computed from active experts

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Load Balancing
**Challenge**: Uneven expert usage leads to device imbalance  
**Solution**: Expert assignment algorithms, load-aware routing

### 2. Communication Overhead
**Challenge**: Inter-device communication for token routing  
**Solution**: Efficient batching, asynchronous communication

### 3. Memory Management
**Challenge**: Expert weight loading and caching  
**Solution**: Dynamic loading, LRU caching strategies

### 4. Fault Tolerance
**Challenge**: Device failures affecting expert availability  
**Solution**: Expert replication, graceful degradation

## Future Work

## Performance Projections

### Single Machine (8 GPUs)
- **Memory per GPU**: ~4GB (vs 32GB full model)
- **Communication**: High-speed NVLink/PCIe
- **Expected speedup**: 2-4x over single GPU
- **Bottleneck**: Communication bandwidth

### Multi-Node (8 nodes × 8 GPUs)
- **Total capacity**: 64 devices, 512 experts potential
- **Memory per node**: ~4GB model weights
- **Communication**: Network-bound
- **Expected speedup**: 10-20x over single node
- **Bottleneck**: Network latency and bandwidth

## Conclusion
